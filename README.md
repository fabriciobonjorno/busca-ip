# Find Ips and Server =)

This is my first project with Go, to run the Ips and servers queries just run the commands below.

## Commands

- Find with Ips: go run main.go ip --host amazon.com.br 
- Find with Servers: go run main.go servidores --host google.com.br

## Commands with Build
- Find with Ips: ./command-line ip --host amazon.com.br
- Find with Servers: ./command-line servidores --host amazon.com.br
